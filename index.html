          <h4>Maths Calculator</h4>
          <p>
            First project that incorporated what we have previously covered with
            HTML and CSS, as well as introducing JavaScript and a new style of
            CSS; SCSS. The ability to use multiple operators, as well as
            inverting numbers and incorportaing decimal points. The sum feature
            works as intended and produces accurate results.

          <h4>Web-based Game</h4>
          <p>
            Using already understood knowledge and applied logic through
            learning, the next project was to create a web-based game utilising
            JavaScript. This game allows user interactability as well as
            allowing replayability in the way that the code has been setup. A
            simple concept of correctly matching pairs, once under the hood,
            prooved to be a very interesting use of the DOM as well as how to
            store color picks with a matching function.

          <h4>Ticket Tracker</h4>
          <p>
            A work concept that allows an employer to track all active jobs that
            an employee may have outstanding as well as being able to individual
            increment or decrement the values. This was the first project that
            included React and was a great way of introducing it from what we
            have previously covered in the course.

          <h4>Brewdog API</h4>
          <p>
            Working with an API for the first time, this project allows the user
            to refine search terms by using either the searchbox or using a
            filter checkbox, which then filters the items received by the api to
            show the user. With this project, you're able to see how you can
            minimilise code and have different containers and components to use
            for better reading and understanding.
          </p>

          <h6>JavaScript/React/Node/MySQL</h6>
          <h4>Todo List</h4>
          <p>
            The first introduction of MySQL and Node, this project is a simple
            concept of creating a todo list, but has a lot going on behind the
            scenes. Fully back-end you're able to see how the user could use an
            application like "PostMan" to view tasks, input their own, update
            existing onces and delete specific tasks by their id. Integrated
            with a full working database on MySQL to store all data.

          <h6>Java/Node/Springboot</h6>
          <h4>Hangman & Snap games</h4>
          <p>
            An introduction into learning Java and Springboot saw me tasked with
            creating two games that were based on simple rules and
            understandings. The games have been created with the user in mind,
            ASCII art is used to add some creativity to the projects as well as
            replayability functions.
